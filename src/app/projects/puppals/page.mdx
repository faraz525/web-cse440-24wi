Dog socialization often gets overlooked despite its crucial role in contributing 
to the well-being and happiness of dogs. While many new owners may be unequipped 
with the proper resources to find safe and compatible playmates for their companions, 
how can we leverage this gap and focus on fostering safe and accessible socialization?

Introducing PupPals, an innovative solution that addresses the challenges of fostering 
safe and accessible dog socialization and location tracking. PupPals utilizes a collar 
wearable and mobile application where owners can discover compatible playmates for their 
dogs and locate nearby dog-friendly parks and trails with ease. By leveraging technology 
to bridge the gap in resources, PupPals empowers owners to prioritize socialization and 
enhance the well-being of their dogs.

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

Our design research process focused on understanding the challenges and needs 
surrounding dog well-being, particularly in the socialization domain. Our primary 
goal was to gain insights into the barriers hindering effective socialization and 
to identify areas for enhancement. To achieve this, we conducted semi-structured 
interviews with a diverse set of participants, including a veterinary assistant, 
as well as both new and experienced dog owners in the Greater Seattle area. By 
engaging individuals with varying levels of experience, we aimed to gather a diverse 
range of insights regarding the care and socialization of their dogs. Additionally, 
by seeking input from professionals like veterinarians, we strived to gain valuable 
perspectives to guide the direction of our project. Through these semi-structured 
interviews, we aimed to gain a better understanding of current practices in pet 
care and identify opportunities to improve the welfare of dogs. 


### All Dog Breeds Have Different Needs

After conducting our three interviews, a prevalent theme across the participants was 
that all dogs have individual needs, with variance across different breeds, ages, and 
health conditions. One of our participants shared an anecdote describing a younger dog 
requiring more exercise and socialization due to their lack of training and high energy 
levels compared to an older dog, whose exercise needs and energy levels were significantly 
lower. With this new insight, we concluded there's no universal approach to proper dog 
care and socialization. Therefore, our design must accommodate and prioritize flexibility 
when taking into consideration the different temperaments, energy levels, disability and 
health considerations, and socialization needs. 

### Proper Socialization Should Be Enforced at a Young Age

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: dogs,
        alt: "Dog of each of our participants.",
    }}
    caption={
        "Design Research Participant Dogs."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

During our design research process, a theme that emerged from participant interviews was 
the importance of early socialization for dogs. One participant emphasized the potential 
risks associated with inadequately socialized dogs, highlighting concerns about their behavior 
toward other pets and humans. This insight was shaped by our understanding of the challenges 
faced by dog owners in facilitating effective socialization, as well as the feedback received 
from participants about the impact of early experiences on a dog’s behavior. Our design process 
was informed by this insight, driving us to prioritize features aimed at promoting safe and 
positive social interactions for dogs from a young age.

</ProjectImageBlock>

### Fostering Community Among Dog Owners

Insights from participants highlighted a strong desire among dog owners to build a healthy 
and supportive community where they can connect with others who share similar interests and 
experiences. During the interviews, two of our participants emphasized the importance of 
features that facilitate social connections such as organizing meetups, dog-friendly events, 
and other activities like walks or training sessions. This key insight underscores the 
significance of integrating socialization features into our design solution, fostering a 
sense of belonging among dog owners while addressing their practical needs for social interaction and support.


## Iterative Design Process and Key Insights

The design focus for our iterative design process was centered around two main tasks: 
Finding appropriate dogs to play with and finding a safe and social walking route using 
location services. To ensure that the user experience was intuitive, we outlined a user 
flow that essentially became the blueprint for our paper prototype. Once the user flow was 
finalized, the paper prototype was designed through a digital drawing tool called Goodnotes. 
For our usability tests, our participant sample consisted of newer and more experienced dog 
owners located in the Greater Seattle area. This participant sample brought a diverse range 
of valuable insights on how we can make PupPals a more user-friendly and inclusive app for 
owners with all ranges of expertise, as well as refine our two critical task pathways. 
Through the feedback and critique received through these tests, we finalized the paper 
prototype. We then translated the paper prototype into a digital mockup, bringing PupPals to life.

### Specify Privacy Terms and Settings

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={
        {
            src: privacy,
            alt: "Describes privacy terms of PupPals and what information is being collected (left), Screen with settings for socialization preferences (right).",
        }}
    caption={
        "Privacy Terms (left), Socialization Preferences (right)."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

From our usability tests, we noted that during the onboarding process of creating an account, 
all participants expressed confusion and concern about their safety and privacy regarding the 
social aspects of the app. This can deter users from the PupPals app. Therefore, adding a 
screen about the app’s privacy terms and the agreement will provide transparency about how 
the app uses the users’ information. 

</ProjectImageBlock>

import home from "public/images/projects/puppals/post/home.png";

### Include a Bottom Navigation Bar

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: navigation_bar,
        alt: "Home page of PupPals (left), Socialization Task Pathway (right)",
    }}
    caption={
        "Home Page (left), Socialization Page of PupPals (right)."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Our initial interface included “forward” and “back” buttons to navigate between screens. 
During the usability test, the participants found it to be inconvenient if they wanted to 
return to the home page. Our participants provided feedback by suggesting a bottom navigation 
bar would enhance usability by creating more efficiency when navigating to different main 
pages easily and quickly.


</ProjectImageBlock>

### Implement More Accessibility Features

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
            src: acc,
            alt: "Screen where owners can send messages and pictures, can also use voice-to-text feature (left), Screen for reporting hazards with user location and desription (right).",
        }}
    caption={
        "Chat Feature Between Owners (left), Reporting Nearby Hazards (right)."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

During our heuristic evaluation, we realized that we made some assumptions about the user of our 
mobile application. In the chat portion of our app, our initial design assumed that users would 
not have any barriers to physically typing messages on a mobile keyboard and reading messages 
received from other owners. This would make a key feature of the app very difficult for many users, 
so we updated our design to include speech-to-text and text-to-speech features in the chat home.

</ProjectImageBlock>

## Resulting Design

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
            src: paper,
            alt: "Overview of Paper Prototype for Mobile Application with most important pages",
        }}
    caption={
        "Overview of Paper Prototype for Mobile Application."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Our final design for PupPals involves both a physical collar wearable and a
digital mobile application. We transitioned our paper prototype into a digital mockup using the design
tool, Figma. Our critical aspects of the design follow the primary tasks of finding appropriate dogs to
play with and finding a safe and social walking route using location tracking. 

</ProjectImageBlock>

### Collar Wearable
<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
            src: collar,
            alt: "Digtal Mockup for Collar Wearable with lights.",
        }}
    caption={
        "Light-up Collar Wearable."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Our digital mockup of the collar wearable features a Bluetooth button to sync the collar to the user’s device. 
The collar also has a light-up component which changes based on the dog’s location and safety.

</ProjectImageBlock>

### Onboarding Process

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: onboarding,
        alt: "Opening screen features a log-in or sign-up option (left), Screen for the users to log in with their username and password if they already have the account.",
    }}
    caption={
        "Opening Page (left), Log In (right)."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

When users open the PupPals mobile app, they will create an account (if this is their first time using the app), otherwise log in.

</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: onboarding_2,
        alt: "Screen describing the privacy terms of PupPals and what information is being collected (left), Screen breaking down the step-by-step instructions for connecting the collar wearable to the PupPals app (right).",
    }}
    caption={
        "Privacy Terms (left), Connecting Device to Collar Wearable (right)."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Proceeding with the onboarding process for users who are creating a new account, they will be 
prompted to the privacy terms and they need to check the agreement box on the bottom to use the app. 
They will then connect the collar wearable device with the app via Bluetooth.


</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: onboarding_3,
        alt: "Screen describing one of the socialization settings of PupPals (left), Screen for editing or adding a new dog’s profile (right).",
    }}
    caption={
        "Settings Page (left), Dog’s Profile Page (right)."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

During this process of the onboarding process, users can modify the settings for the device and app, 
which can be edited later on. Lastly, users create a profile for their dog and review it.


</ProjectImageBlock>

### Task 1: Finding Appropriate Dogs to Play With
<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: socialization_1,
        alt: "Home screen with two critical task pathways of socialization and location tracker (left), Screen for starting the socialization, which is by finding nearby friends (right).",
    }}
    caption={
        "Home Page of PupPals (left), Socialization Main Page (right)."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Users will be prompted to the home page, where the users will click the “Socialization” button.

</ProjectImageBlock>


<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: socialization_2,
        alt: "Screen for inserting the dog’s age (left), Screen for changing/inserting the location (right).",
    }}
    caption={
        "Age Preferences (left), Location (right)."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Users are prompted to fill out socialization preferences based on the dog’s age and personality 
type. From here, users are asked to input their zip code, city, or use their current location to 
find potential playmates who are local to them.

</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: friend,
        alt: "Screen to find potential friend matches (left), Screen displaying the owner’s friends list (right).",
    }}
    caption={
        "Potential Friends (left), Friends List (right)."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>
Based on the user location, profiles of nearby dogs are generated. The users can scroll through 
each profile and determine potential matches for their dogs to play with. If the users find a playmate 
they would like to connect with, they can click the “Send Request” button.
When a friend request has been accepted, users can view their friends list and use the chat feature to arrange meetups. 


</ProjectImageBlock>

### Task 2: Finding a Safe and Social Walking Route Using Location Services

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: tracking_1,
        alt: "Home screen with two critical task pathways of socialization and location tracker (left), Screen with features of location tracker pathway (right).",
    }}
    caption={
        "Home Page of PupPals (left), Location Tracking Main Page (right)."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Through the home page, users will click the “Location Tracker” button.

</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: tracking_2,
        alt: "Screen showing the location tracking features on the PupPals app (left), Screen displaying local walking routes based on the nearest location (right).",
    }}
    caption={
        "Location Features (left), Walking Routes Based on Nearest Location (right)."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Users will then select the “Walking Routes Near Me” button. From here, they can enter the desired 
zip code or city to find local dog-friendly walking routes, and the users will be given a list of locations.

</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: tracking_3,
        alt: "Screen for entering zip code or nearest city (left), Screen for filtering the walking routes for the dog (right).",
    }}
    caption={
        "Enter Zip Code (left), Filter Routes Page (right)."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Based on the user zip code, owners can use the filter option to narrow down the distance 
and type of location they would like to visit (dog park, park, walking route). Locations 
will be generated according to the noted preferences.


</ProjectImageBlock>

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: tracking_4,
        alt: "Screen for reporting hazards with user location and desription (left), Screen for tracking dog's location (right).",
    }}
    caption={
        "Report Hazard Page (left), Track Dog's Location (right)."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

The tracking feature allows users to view their dog’s location in real-time.
The outlined area will reflect the light-up component on the collar wearable.
Additionally, users can use the report button to notify other owners of any hazards in the area
– if the report feature is utilized, this will reflect a red light on the collar wearable.
